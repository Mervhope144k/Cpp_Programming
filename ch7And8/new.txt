              1:  by Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera
              2: 
              3: I want to die as the day declines, 
              4: at high sea and facing the sky, 
              5: while agony seems like a dream 
              6: and my soul like a bird that can fly. 
              7: 
              8: To hear not, at this last moment, 
              9: once alone with sky and sea, 
             10: any more voices nor weeping prayers 
             11: than the majestic beating of the waves. 
             12: 
             13: To die when the sad light retires 
             14: its golden network from the green waves 
             15: to be like the sun that slowly expires; 
             16: something very luminous that fades. 
             17: 
             18: To die, and die young, before 
             19: fleeting time removes the gentle crown, 
             20: while life still says: "I'm yours" 
             21: though we know with our hearts that she lies.
